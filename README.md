# Character profile
This is the repository of my main character's page in my Neocities page (aka The Underground Garden), page that you can watch live [here](https://tsurabe-workshop.neocities.org/html/donovan_ref)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Being guided by existing code is helpful when you are starting to program, I've always supported that.<br>
> <br>Developing a website from scratch or using a template depends on your own creativity.<br>
> <br>Please, <b>Don't copy the whole code from this repository</b> and always keep in mind what I said before
